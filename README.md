![](art/epeek.gif)

Explosions is a program created using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. Through SDL and its extended libraries, the project of Explosions was created as an introduction to video game programming. 


To run the program, perform the following command:

    make 
    ./explosion

Once the program is running, press left-click to make your mouse cursor explode and right-click to create multiple explosions.
